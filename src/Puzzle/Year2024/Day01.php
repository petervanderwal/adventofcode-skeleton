// in one single class if that helps you.

// by this bundle.

    // you can't have two methods with the same year+day+part
    #[Puzzle(year: 2024, day: 1, part: 1)]

    // Every puzzle in Advent of Code contains an example input with an expected answer. It is good practice to test
    // your implementation against this example. If this test fails, this bundle will not (try to) execute & submit the
    // full puzzle.

        // about the input (whether it is a demo input or full input) that can be helpful during debugging.

        // The PuzzleInput object is of the type UnicodeString provided by
        // Symfony (https://symfony.com/doc/current/string.html#usage), supporting operations such as:
        $chunks = $input->trimEnd('.')->chunk(15);

        // but can also be converted to a raw string if that's more useful to you:
        $rawInput = (string)$input;

        // Next to that it provides some extra information about the input that can be helpful during debugging:
        $isDemoInput = $input->isDemoInput();
        $demoInputName = $input->demoInputName;

        // Last but not least, your method should return either an integer or a string:
        $answer = $this->someCalculation();
        return $answer;
    }

    // You can add the second part of the puzzle within the same class, but you can also create a separate class for it.
    // As long as it has the #[Puzzle] attribute on it
//    #[Puzzle(year: 2024, day: 1, part: 2)]
