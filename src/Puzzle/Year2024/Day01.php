    // full puzzle.

        // Symfony (https://symfony.com/doc/current/string.html#usage), supporting operations such as:
        $chunks = $input->trimEnd('.')->chunk(15);

        // but can also be converted to a raw string if that's more useful to you:
        $rawInput = (string)$input;

        // Next to that it provides some extra information about the input that can be helpful during debugging:
        $isDemoInput = $input->isDemoInput();
        $demoInputName = $input->demoInputName;
